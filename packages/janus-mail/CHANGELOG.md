# @nxgt/janus-mail

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#102](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/102) [`174478e`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/174478e444b5471810910e0db988e21b78899693) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The `TypeError` for a locale that `Intl` rejects now reads `janusMail: locales must be BCP 47 language tags, as 'fr-CA'`. The words "with hyphens" are gone: they misled for `i-klingon` or `x-foo`, which already hold hyphens and are refused anyway. The check itself is unchanged. Code that matches the old message text must match the new one.

- [#104](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/104) [`26d0b69`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/26d0b69cae5d66ab0eb8367a5b153a26bdac4878) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The e-mails are now built with `@nxgt/mail-i18n` 0.4.0, `@nxgt/mail-ui` 0.3.0 and `@nxgt/mail-presets` 0.3.0, whose message keys moved to kebab-case. The package names no key, so the built `mails/` is byte for byte the same as before: the e-mails, their subjects, their variables and the manifest (format 1) are unchanged. The `@nxgt/mail` peer is unchanged.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#100](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/100) [`3d5e5b7`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/3d5e5b7b71b3e8997136537c2004781630ba5df6) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The verification, password-reset and sign-in code e-mails now say how long the link or code lasts: "This link expires in 1 hour.", "Ce lien expire dans 1 heure." The text is derived from the flow's `expiresAt` at send time, in the recipient's locale. The time left is rounded to the minute, then down to the largest whole unit (days, hours or minutes), and formatted with `Intl.NumberFormat`. To give your own wording, pass it as a third argument: `mail.verifyEmail(issued, to, { expiresIn: '24 heures' })`.
  
  - **Breaking.** There are two breaks:
    - `JanusMailVariables` gains `expiresIn` for `verifyEmail`, `resetPassword` and `signInCode`. Code that calls a template directly must now pass it, for example `janusTemplates().resetPassword({ …, expiresIn: '1 heure', locale })` or `mail.templates.verifyEmail({ …, expiresIn, locale })`. An override is given `expiresIn` and may ignore it.
    - `signInCode` now reads `issued.expiresAt`. An argument built by hand, such as `{ code, email }`, must add `expiresAt`. Passing the flow's answer whole still compiles.
  - **New errors.** A send whose `expiresAt` is not a valid `Date` (for example, a flow's answer that went through JSON) or is already in the past is a `TypeError`, and nothing is sent. So is a `clock` whose `now()` does not return a `Date`. `janusMail()` now also refuses, with a `TypeError`, any locale in `locales` that `Intl` rejects, such as `de_DE`. Write it as `de-DE`.
  - **Rebuilt e-mails.** The defaults are rebuilt with `@nxgt/mail-presets` 0.2.0, `@nxgt/mail-config` 0.2.1, `@nxgt/mail-ui` 0.2.0 and `@nxgt/mail-i18n` 0.3.1. The text parts no longer break a sentence across lines. The `@nxgt/mail` peer stays `>=0.1.0 <1`.
  - **New option.** `janusMail({ clock })` sets the clock the time left is measured against. Pass it the clock you gave `janus({ clock })`, such as a `fixedClock` in tests. It defaults to the system clock. Tests that give `janus()` a clock set in the past need it here too.
  - **New export.** `JanusMailSendOptions` is now exported.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#97](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/97) [`9f196da`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/9f196da2edcd9231fdc3a21a5f928fa085bf5ab4) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The first release: the e-mails of `@nxgt/janus`'s flows — e-mail verification, password reset, sign-in code, and the notices *password changed* and *e-mail changed* — in English and French, sent through any `@nxgt/mail` transport. `janusMail({ mailer, from, brand, links })` takes what each flow answers, as it answers it; `janusTemplates()` answers the five default templates, without a mailer. The e-mails are built with Maizzle when this package is built and shipped in `mails/`, so your server only fills them in — your brand, the recipient's name, your links, every value escaped — with no template engine. Any one of them can be your own function, and a send rejects with the mailer's own `MailFailure` or `MailRefused`. Peers: `@nxgt/mail` 0.1 or later below 1, `@nxgt/janus` 0.8, and `typescript` 6. Keep the package external to your server bundle, so `mails/` is deployed with it.
