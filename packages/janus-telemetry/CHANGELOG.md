### Patch Changes

- [#58](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/58) [`93c1530`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/93c1530a5a1ae406dbc345e1c20a81da4f074272) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The audit trail records a subject as `permissions()` reads it. `janus.subject.relation` was set whenever the subject had a `relation` field, so a user with such a field was logged as a subject set that was never stored. It is now set only for a real set: one `setOf()` made, or `{ type, id, relation }` on an object type. The user types come from the instance's `model`. Needs `@nxgt/janus` 0.3.0, for `isSetOf`.

  - @nxgt/janus@0.3.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/pull/55) [`ebe6b61`](https://github.com/softistx/nxgt-janus/commit/ebe6b6102bde1d78e52991ba9a41f019ac92452e) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The first release: `instrumentJanus` and `instrumentPermissions` wrap an instance of `@nxgt/janus` so that every flow and every permission check is a span, and the security events worth an audit trail are recorded — never a login, an e-mail, a password, a session token, a one-time token or a session id.
