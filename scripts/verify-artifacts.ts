#!/usr/bin/env bun

/**
 * Packs every package, installs the tarballs the way a consumer does, and
 * imports every subpath each one declares.
 *
 * This exists because `bun run build` exiting 0 proves almost nothing here.
 * The specs import each sibling's source, so nothing they run loads `dist/`.
 * In nxgt-core, where this script comes from, three defects shipped past a
 * green build, each throwing the instant its package was imported, and all
 * three invisible to `bun run build`, `bun typecheck` and `biome`.
 * Only importing the built artifact catches that class of failure. A bin is
 * the same story, so each one declared is run from `node_modules/.bin` with
 * `--help`: that proves the link, the `#!` line and the mode together.
 *
 * The install uses `overrides` so the packages resolve to each other's
 * tarballs rather than to whatever is on the registry — otherwise this would
 * silently verify the *published* versions instead of the working tree.
 * Everything else resolves from the registry the way a consumer's install
 * does. Optional peers are installed too, the way a
 * consumer who uses the subpath that needs one would.
 *
 * Each check lives in `scripts/artifacts/`, one module per responsibility;
 * this file only runs them in order and stops at the first that fails.
